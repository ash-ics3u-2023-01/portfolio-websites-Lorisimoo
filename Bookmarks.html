            <a href="https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/">CMU</a>
            <p>In CMU Acdemy we learned to make all sorts of designs and images using python</p>
            <p>Here is one of the images I created with my class mates alongside the code</p>

            <a href="https://codehs.com/">CodeHS</a>
            <br>
            <p>CodeHS was where we learned most of our python during the course. It was an amazing resource that was able to simplify coding</p>
            <br>

            <a href=" https://replit.com/~">Replit</a>
            <br>
            <p>At the beginning of the semester, replit was the first IDE (integrated development environment) we used in class.</p>
            <p>An IDE is a software that allows developers (like me) to make code</p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>
            <p>Later in the semester we changed to GitHub which was also an IDE like replit</p>
            <p>The major difference between the two is that in GitHub you can download extensions that help you with your code.</p>

            <br>
            <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>
            <br>
            <p>Finally vscode is the last IDE we used this semester and is the one being used to code this website.</p>
            <p>its almost the same to github interms of the user interface and its accessibilities</p>
